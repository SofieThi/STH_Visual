## Self-assigned project: How well can a model predict which sport is happening in the images?

This repository contains the answers to the following tasks:

-Make the https://www.kaggle.com/code/victorxiao4/sports-tf/data smaller (20 classes instead of 100) by only including the first 20 folders (alphabethical order) in the train, test and valid folders

-Train a sequential model from TensorFlow to predict which of the 20 classes the image belongs to

-Find out how well the model performs

-Generate plot history and save it to output folder


## Structure

This repository has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```data```| a folder to be used for inputting the data you wish to run
```notebooks``` | Jupyter notebooks in both .ipynb and .html format
```src``` | the .py script version of the assignment
```output``` | the results of inputting the kaggle Sport tf dataset

## Usage (reproducing results)

In order to run this code, clone the repository and store the data in the data folder. You will need the packages in the requirements.txt document.

To replicate the results choose the flowers dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/code/victorxiao4/sports-tf/data and remove all but the 20 first folders in alphabethical order (keeping the classes: air hockey to cheerleading). The code can run with the whole dataset with 100 classes, but it will take a long time.
