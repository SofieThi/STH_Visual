The code does the following:

One script should be called logistic_regression.py and should do the following:

Load either the MNIST_784 data or the CIFAR_10 data

Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn

Print the classification report to the terminal and save the classification report to out/lr_report.txt

Another scripts should be called nn_classifier.py and should do the following:

Load either the MNIST_784 data or the CIFAR_10 data

Train a Neural Network model using the premade module in neuralnetwork.py

Print output to the terminal during training showing epochs and loss

Print the classification report to the terminal and save the classification report to out/nn_report.txt
